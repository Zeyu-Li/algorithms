# Quick Algorithms or Formulas

## About

This is a collection of algorithms, formulas, or  written in different programing languages

## ADT

* Stack [O(1) constant]
* Bounded Queues [O(n) linear time]
* Circular Queues [O(1) constant]

The next two have a node (SLinkedListNode or DLinkedListNode) and the implementation (SLinkedList or DLinkedList)

* Singly Linked List [O(n) linear time] 
* Doubly Linked List [O(n) linear time] 

## Algorithms

* GCD (greatest common denominator) by Euclidean algorithm
* LCM (least common multiple) uses GCD

## How to Use

For MacOS or Linux:

```shell
python3 name_of_program.py
```

For Windows:

```powershell
py name_of_program.py
```
